## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and React.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/avezqureshi14/static-site-generator.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash

```

This command starts the development server on `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to the source code will be automatically reflected in the browser.
